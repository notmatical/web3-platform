# Web3 Social Platform
This platform has been used in various projects, it was orignally created by matical (@opiateful) for his project Cosmic Astronauts and parent company Minx Labs. After launching he sold the NFT projects' IP to Yaku Corp, and joined as a Dev Lead. Not long after he parted ways after some team issues arose and withheld the rights to the code.

His love for the Solana blockchain still remained and he wanted to give everyone in the ecosystem a tool that wasn't gatekept by a monhtly SPL Token charge. But with other business opportunities arising in his life he just didn't have time to dedicate to continue building the platform for the community. 

# Getting Started

You will notice two folders: `api` & `server`
> The API folder is a headless backend that runs alongside the vercel deployment.
> The Server folder is the development environment backend which is 1:1 with the API folder but is used for rapid iteration and hotloading of new features.

# Installation Process
    - run 'npm install / yarn' in both root and server directories
    - to start dev server run 'npm run start / yarn start' in the root directory
    - to start backend server run 'npm run dev / yarn dev' in the server directory
    - obtain a Hyperspace API key by requesting one from their team and putting it in config.ts

# Leave a Star :star:
Don't forget to leave a star and a follow if you find this useful in any way, it comes with a lot of features. Some finished others are works in progress that won't be getting updated/finished again.
